# Simulateur

This project contains a few financial tools built with React and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Battre l'inflation** – compare your custom investment against the Livret A.
- **Projet immobilier** – simulate a rental real estate investment and visualize cashflows and remaining loan over time.

Use the navigation links in the header ("Battre l'inflation" and "Projet Immo") or the cards on the home page to access each tool.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```
